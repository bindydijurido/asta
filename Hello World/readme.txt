Hello,

I decided to refresh (if this is properly word) my github. Actually I started today (28.06.17) but I will improve my profile on and on in my free time. 

I am open for your sugestions, critic and discussions. 

My tests are build for:  https://testingcup.pgs-soft.com/task_1 - feel free to face every prepeared challange by them. 

Have a good day,

Bindy
