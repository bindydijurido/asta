Hello Folks!

This is my very first repository, that I've ever built on :) I feel so sentimental when I look at this archive. I learned a lot here.

I changed a code structure there and there. This is very strange feeling, when you're looking at your very first, old code - you realize, that the first pancake is always spoiled ;)

I am aware, that this repository isn't ideal but I don't want to waste my time with 'spoiled' stuff anymore. 
Now it's time to share something much more interesting with the world!

best,
